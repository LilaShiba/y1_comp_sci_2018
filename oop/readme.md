## OOP Three Pillars
	Encapsulation
	Inheritance
	Polymorphism

### Class
A blueprint for an instance

### Object 
An Object is a unit of data that has associated functionality

### Instance 
A constructed object of the class. The creation of an instance is called instantiation. In class-based programming, objects are created from classes by subroutines called constructors, and destroyed by destructors. An object is an instance of a class, and may be called a class instance or class object; instantiation is then also known as construction

### Type 
Indicates the class the instace belongs to

### Attribute
Any object value. Like a noun

### Method 
A callable attribute. Like a verb

### Encapsulation
Building walls around a module (a hard shell or capsule) so that the module is responsible for its own internal behavior, and bugs in other parts of the system canâ€™t damage its integrity

### Abstraction
Omitting or hiding low-level details with a simpler, higher-level idea

### Inheritance
Enables new objects to take on the properties of existing objects

### Polymorphism
In object-oriented programming, polymorphism refers to a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class. More specifically, it is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes

### Module
A module is just a file that contains python code

### Subprogram
Subprograms may be defined within programs, or separately in libraries that can be used by multiple programs. In different programming languages, a subroutine may be called a procedure, a function, a routine, a method, or a subprogram. The generic term callable unit is sometimes used.
