# Web Science
In this unit you will learn to work with API's and launch your website. You will have the option of having your website do whatever you want. For example, if you are more into backend programming, cool, we can add some great features!

There are no limits here.

### Example API Calls

Google Maps API:

Weather API:

## But I Hate Web Dev
I get that, so, you can work on machine learning! Just make sure you can program an API call by creating, in your local env, the google maps API call.

The ml5 folder is for machine learning. I highly recommend that you have a buddy for this task.

# Programming Concepts

### Recursion
Recursion is a tool a programmer can use to invoke a function call on itself. Fibonacci sequence is the textbook example of how recursion is used. Most recursive code if not all can be expressed as iterative function, but its usually messy.

### Nested Loops
A nested loop is a loop within a loop, an inner loop within the body of an outer one. Then the second pass of the outer loop triggers the inner loop again. This repeats until the outer loop finishes. Of course, a break within either the inner or outer loop would interrupt this process.

### Nested Arrays
A nested, or multidimensional array, is an array whose individual elements are also arrays


## Ideas to Focus On

#### Usability & Problems
the ease of use and learnability of a human-made
object. The object of use can be a software application,
website, machine, process, or anything a human interacts

#### The need for change management
 The process of requesting, determining attainability, planning, implementing, and evaluating of changes to a system. Its main goals are to support the processing and traceability of changes to an interconnected set of factors

#### Data Loss
- How 
- Why
- What can I do?
- What could go wrong ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
