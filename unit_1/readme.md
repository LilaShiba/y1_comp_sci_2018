# Programming Everyday Problems
In this unit you will use everything from the first unit to 
solve everyday programming problems. 

You will focus on the design process of programming and debugging, hurray. In addition, you will be creating a portfolio that you will be able to send to colleges and use for job interviews.

## Code Wars
You will need to create an account. The goal is to get to level 6 by the end of this unit!
https://www.codewars.com

## Github
All code will need to be pushed to github, and you will edit your peers work on github as well. This means, you need to find and friend each other

## Heroku
Time to sign up for Heroku! You are going to build and launch a portfolio website. In unit one, you will be working on production and in unit two you will deploy.

## Projects
projects change based on need of the class
here are a few examples

- longest word
- reversed string
- most frequent item in an array
- hangman game
- encryption program
- rake garden
- array element parity
- kebabize
- counting Duplicates
- getting to lvl 6 on codewars!


## Computer Structure
Shout out to Dartford Grammar School for providing free
slides & definitions on these topics!
### CPU
Central Processing Unit
The key component of a computer system,
which contains the circuitry necessary to
interpret and execute program instructions

### ALU
Arithmetic Logic Unit
Part of the CPU that does all the arithmetic (+/-) and logical
(AND/OR) calculations
Sometimes an ALU is referred to a ‘core’, hence computers
with dual core technology have two ALUs to process two
calculations simultaneously. 

### CU
Control Unit
It handles the loading of new commands into
the CPU and the decoding of these commands.
Also, it directs the data flow and the operation
of the ALU.

### Registers 
small temporary storage spaces inside the CPU 
they are small, very fast circuits that store
intermediate values from calculations or instructions inside
the CPU.
There are many small units, but the four most important
ones are:
#### MAR
- MAR is connected to the address bus.
- MAR is contains a memory address.
- MAR’s sole function contain the RAM address of the
instruction the CPU wants next.
#### MDR
- MDR is connected to the data bus.
- MDR holds data that will be written to the RAM or that was
	read from RAM.
- Relationship between MAR & MDR: The MAR gives the
	address the data of the MDR will be read from or written to
#### Accumulator
 holds the intermediate results
 of the currently running instructions
#### Program Counter
holds the memory addressof the next instruction

### RAM = Random Access Memory
- Contains the data and instructions the
computer has loaded since starting up and
everything the user has opened/loaded.
- Is volatile = loses its contents if power is lost
- Has a special link to the CPU

### ROM = Read Only Memory
- Originally its contents were static (hence ‘read only’) and
could not be changed – not true any more (“flash
upgrades”).
- Non-volatile = does not lose its contents if power is lost
- Stores the BIOS (Basic Input Output System) – a small
program that allows the computer to know what to do to
find the operating system to ‘boot’ the computer after
power is restored.

###  Cache
A type of small, high-speed memory inside the
CPU used to hold frequently used data, so that
the CPU needs to access the much slower RAM
less frequently

###  machine instruction cycle

### bit
Computers use binary - the digits 0 and 1 - to store
data. A binary digit, or bit, is the smallest unit of data
in computing. It is represented by a 0 or a 1

###  byte
Bits can be grouped together to make them easier to
work with. A group of 8 bits is called a byte.

### binary
- Computers use binary - the digits 0 and 1 - to store data.
- Because it only has 2 symbols (0 & 1) it is also called BASE-2
numbering
- Binary also refers to the format in which numbers are
transmitted and calculated in a computer system

### denary
Denary is a numbering system with 10 symbols: 0123456789
It is, therefore, often referred to as BASE-10 numbering

### hexadecimal
- Hexadecimal is a numbering system with 16 symbols:
0123456789ABCDEF
- It is, therefore, often referred to as BASE-16 numbering.
- Hex, as it is often called, is used to represent very large
numbers quickly, such as those used in colour
representation

## Planning 
### GANTT charts
You will need to create a Gantt chart for your unit 2 final project.
