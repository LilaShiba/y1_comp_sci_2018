## Concepts to Know

### Variable:
The variable's name represents what information the variable contains. They are called variables because the represented information can change but the operations on the variable remain the same

### Constant:
In computer programming, a constant is a value that cannot be altered by the program during normal execution, i.e., the value is constant. ... This is contrasted with a variable, which is an identifier with a value that can be changed during normal execution, i.e., the value is variable.

### Operations:
an operator is a character that represents an action, as for example x is an arithmetic operator that represents multiplication. In computer programs, one of the most familiar sets of operators, the Boolean operators, is used to work with true/false values.

### Function:
In programming, a named section of a program that performs a specific task. In this sense, a function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value.

### Method:
A method in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with a message and an object. An object is mostly made up of data and behavior, which form the interface that an object presents to the outside world. Data is represented as properties of the object and behavior as methods.

### Control Flow:
A program's control flow is the order in which the program's code executes.

### Loop or Iterator:
a loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. Typically, a certain process is done, such as getting an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked such as whether a counter has reached a prescribed number

### Conditionals:
perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified boolean condition evaluates to true or false.

### Abstraction:
Through the process of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.

### String Interpolation
In computer programming, string interpolation (or variable interpolation, variable substitution, or variable expansion) is the process of evaluating a string literal containing one or more placeholders, yielding a result in which the placeholders are replaced with their corresponding values

### Class:
A class is a template for creating objects. Think of
a factory making objects that share traits.

### Object:
 In the class-based object-oriented programming paradigm, "object" refers to a particular instance of a class where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.


## AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR and XOR

### AND
The output is "true" when both inputs are "true." Otherwise, the output is "false.".

### OR
The output is "true" if either or both of the inputs are "true." If both inputs are "false," then the output is "false."

### XOR
The output is "true" if either, but not both, of the inputs are "true." The output is "false" if both inputs are "false" or if both inputs are "true."

### NAND
The output is "false" if both inputs are "true." Otherwise, the output is "true."

### NOR
Its output is "true" if both inputs are "false." Otherwise, the output is "false."

### XNOR
Its output is "true" if the inputs are the same, and"false" if the inputs are different.
