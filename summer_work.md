# Summer Work

Summer work is broken into 2 parts: programming and questions.

- Sources may be shared on slack
- Your code must be commented on by one of your peers (try using atom & teletype, github, &| or slack)
- Your final repo should be linked in slack
- [how to add a collaborator on github](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7920320/adding-a-collaborator-to-my-free-github-account)
- [markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/


## Part 1: Programs to Create

Programs should be pushed to github with comments explaining what the heck is going on. A readme should teach a complete noob how to create and understand your program.
